Ethan Meyer, Ishika Patel

## Project Description



## Applications



## Software Prerequisites

 Python 3
 
 Jupyter Notebook
 

## List of Relevant Python Packages

```bash

```

## Data Mining Pipeline
Examined and resolved issues within data, filling in missing information

### Data Cleaning
Familiarized  ourselves with structure and information available within data sets 

### Data Exploration
Developed methodology for connecting numerous data sources

### Computation
Aggregated and computed advanced statistics and Performed betting unit conversion

### Data Warehouse
Precomputed all potential features and Stored in static files to be accessed by models

### Data Modeling
1. Identified potential classification models:
- 4-Factor Model
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- K Nearest Neighbors
2. Hyperparametrized models
3. Outlined potential betting strategies
4. Calculated performance statistics
5. Accuracy & ROI

### Pattern Evaluation
Examined model and betting strategy performance results, Analyzed Accuracy-ROI trade off, Unpacked feature importance, Contextualized findings, Proposed future work 


## Key Findings
1. Between models,  accuracy is not always the best performance measure when optimizing for ROI.
2. Betting based on predetermined weights of a model may not be the best strategy, we need to consider even more enhanced betting strategies
3. Enhanced betting strategies have the potential to drive higher returns.
4. Classification models are capable of returning a positive ROI in sports   betting applications.
